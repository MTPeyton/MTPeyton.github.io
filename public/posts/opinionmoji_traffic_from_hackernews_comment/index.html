<meta name="description" content="On March 26th, while I was eating lunch and reading HackerNews, I saw a thread where people were posting non-AI projects they were working on. On a whim, I decided to comment with a short description of and link to a tiny project I’ve been working on: OpinionMoji.
The resulting traffic bump was neat to watch. Lots of people talk of getting 10,000&#43; visits whenever you post something on HackerNews. However, this was more modest: about 205 visits that first day." />

  <p>On March 26th, while I was eating lunch and reading HackerNews, I saw <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39832237">a thread where people were posting non-AI projects they were working on.</a> On a whim, I decided to comment with a short description of and link to a tiny project I’ve been working on: <a href="https://opinionmoji.com/">OpinionMoji</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting traffic bump was neat to watch. Lots of people talk of getting 10,000+ visits whenever you post something on HackerNews. However, this was more modest: about 205 visits that first day. Then every subsequent day was about half the number of visits as the first day: 76, 33, 9, 4, …</p>

<p>It was cool to see it experience almost perfect exponential decay.</p>
<p>Equally as cool was seeing all of the different countries and cities that people visited from.</p>
