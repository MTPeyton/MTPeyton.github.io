# Hi, I'm Matt!

I'm originally from Philadelphia. I now live in the Bay Area.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a [BA in Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) (concentration in [Urban Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis/urban-science)) in 2019.

I like to tell people it was roughly:

- 1/3rd Computer Science
- 1/3rd Statistics
- 1/3rd Urban Planning

After that, I've worked at a few startups. I've done a mix of the following:

- Backend
- (a little bit of) Frontend
- Database Management
- Data Science
- (a little bit of) Machine Learning

Right now, I'm living and working in San Francisco for [Hivemapper](https://hivemapper.com).
