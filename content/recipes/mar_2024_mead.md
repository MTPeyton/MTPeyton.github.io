Ingredients
- 2 Lbs of Honey
- Several gallons distilled water

Steps
1. Sanitize everything with [Star San (Affiliate Link)](https://amzn.to/44JtSH6)
2. Pour 2 Lbs of honey into a carboy using a funnel
3. Use warm distilled water to wash all of the honey into the carboy
4. Fill the carboy halfway with the warm distilled water
5. Put a stopper in the carboy
6. Shake it a lot! Then shake it some more!
7. Fill the rest of the carboy with distilled water (just below the start of the neck)
8. Take a sample using a siphon into a large beaker
9. Float a hydrometer in the beaker and take a specific gravity measurement
10. Dump the sample back into the carboy
11. Add a packet of yeast and stir
12. Put the stopper back in, put the airlock in, filled with vodka
13. Now put the carboy in storage and wait
14. After the airlock bubbles slow down (typically in a few weeks), take another hydrometer reading
15. Once you have two readings that haven’t changed, OR you don’t see any more bubbles, then it’s ready to bottle
16. Bottle it!

Hydrometer Readings
- 2024-03-06 was 1.097
- 2024-03-31 was 0.996
- 2024-04-16 was 0.992 (Bottled)

Tips
- Make sure the beaker is COMPLETELY full of mead before taking reading
- Mix star san in a large bucket: 1 ounce per 5 gallons of warm distilled water
- Completely coat everything in star san inside-and-out for at least several minutes
- No need to rinse off the star san, it’s food safe
- Be super thorough about sanitizing everything… including your hands
- Don’t use tap water, the chlorine can kill the yeast
