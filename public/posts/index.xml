      <description>Things Already Done Are Still Worth Doing&#xA;It seems like everything has already been done. Just about every storyline, business idea, photograph, English sentence and more have already been done. It’s estimated that there are about 100 billion unique humans that have ever lived. About 8 billion of them are alive right now. That’s a lot of people doing a lot of things. It’s likely, almost guaranteed, that at least one of them has already done the thing you want to do....</description>

      <description>“That’s just, like, your opinion, man.” - The Dude&#xA;Like all opinions, some of these might be wrong, and some might be right. Some might only apply in certain circumstances. But these are the opinions I’ve formed over the last 5+ years on what databases to use, and how to use them.&#xA;Pick relational databases by default. “NoSQL” means “another one-off query language to learn”. Only use alternative databases (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, etc....</description>

      <description>I have a very clear idea of what my &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; computer would be. It would incorporate all of the best aspects of the different computers (including smartphones!) I already use today, into a single machine.&#xA;The What First, it would have the form factor of a typical smartphone. This would allow me to carry it everywhere, and use it both one-handed and two-handed. I might even have it be a “hotdog-style foldable” to allow for comfier reading....</description>

      <description>Before 2017, I was a user of Mint for tracking my personal finances. However, around that time, I realized that it didn&amp;rsquo;t offer me much functionality. Worse, it was storing my banking and investment account credentials in a way that allowed server-side decryption. (In order to do browser automation and screen scraping of financial websites) So I decided to switch to something else.&#xA;2017 was also the year when I decided to start using more Free and Open Source Software in my life....</description>

      <description>For the last decade plus, I’ve been tossing links to interesting pages in all sorts of random places. Firefox bookmarks, Apple Notes, Apple Reminders, Markdown files, emails to myself…&#xA;I figured it was finally time to organize all of that. Plus I’ve also wanted to add more content to my personal website for awhile. With my bookmarked links now organized in a single place, it was easy to auto-generate my bookmarks page....</description>
