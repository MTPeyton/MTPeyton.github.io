# About Me

I'm originally from Philadelphia, and now I live in the Bay Area.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a [BA in Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/data-science-undergraduate-studies/data-science-major) (concentration in [Urban Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/degrees/domain-emphasis/urban-science)) in 2019.

I like to tell people it was roughly:

- 1/3rd Computer Science
- 1/3rd Statistics
- 1/3rd Urban Planning

After that, I've worked at a few startups:

- 2019 - 2021 [Visual Labs](https://visuallabsinc.com/) Body worn cameras and redaction software for law enforcement agencies.
- 2021 - 2023 [Beans.ai](https://www.beans.ai/) Logistics management SaaS for last-mile delivery companies.
- 2024 - Now [Hivemapper](https://hivemapper.com) Geospatial data from a distributed network of dash cameras.

The connecting thread is that they each:

- Have hardware devices deployed in the field...
- That send operational, visual and geospatial data to a cloud platform...
- That processes the data with databases, analytical tools and computer vision...
- The results of which are made available to customers.

Outside of work, I read a lot about science, technology, urban planning, and society. I also enjoy tinkering, gaming, mead-making and walking. Aside from that, I try to live life as best I can!
