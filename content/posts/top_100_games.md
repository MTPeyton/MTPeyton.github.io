I decided to rank the top 100 videogames that I've played.

To make the ranking, I started by listing every videogame I've ever played. I did this through a combination of memory and Steam records.

I then fed all of those into [ThingRanker](https://github.com/MTPeyton/ThingRanker). It's a small Python program I wrote. It takes in a list of strings, and runs an arbitrary number of "matches" against random pairings of two strings. During each match, I choose which string I like better. The program than uses the ELO scoring system to score the strings based on which ones I chose.

I ran 200 matchups against about 150 games. This gave me a rough ordering to start with. I then cut out the 50-ish worst games. After that, I ran about 500 more matchups. The result of this was an ordering I was mosly happy with. I then ended up manually tweaking the positions of about 20 specific games I felt should be higher or lower. After that, I felt pretty happy with the list.
