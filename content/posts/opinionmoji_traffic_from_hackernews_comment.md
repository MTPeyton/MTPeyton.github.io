On March 26th, while I was eating lunch and reading HackerNews, I saw [a thread where people were posting non-AI projects they were working on.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39832237) On a whim, I decided to comment with a short description of and link to a tiny project I’ve been working on: [OpinionMoji](https://opinionmoji.com/).

The resulting traffic bump was neat to watch. Lots of people talk of getting 10,000+ visits whenever you post something on HackerNews. However, this was more modest: about 205 visits that first day. Then every subsequent day was about half the number of visits as the first day: 76, 33, 9, 4, …

It was cool to see it experience almost perfect exponential decay.

Equally as cool was seeing all of the different countries and cities that people visited from.
